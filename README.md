Hey there! I'm Chris, known as PcUserPro. This is my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@pc_user_pro).
I am interested in many aspects of tech, most notably OSes, the insides of Windows OS, VMs, software, engineering.

For those interested in Android devices, here's my [XDA Forums account](https://xdaforums.com/m/pcuserpro.12852972/). Android development and testing is not my primary focus, as I prefer using a computer (I think you could probably tell already lol), but I am kind of familiar with part of the Android inner workings, as well as rooting, ADB, and installing custom ROM, partially: modification of a ROM.
